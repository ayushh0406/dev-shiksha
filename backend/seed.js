**Types of Scaling:**

**Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)**
‚Ä¢ Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to existing machines
‚Ä¢ Pros: Simple, no application changes needed
‚Ä¢ Cons: Hardware limits, single point of failure
‚Ä¢ Example: Upgrading from 8GB to 32GB RAM

**Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)**
‚Ä¢ Adding more machines to the pool of resources
‚Ä¢ Pros: Virtually unlimited scaling, fault tolerance
‚Ä¢ Cons: Complex application design, data consistency challenges
‚Ä¢ Example: Adding more web servers behind a load balancer

**Key Principles:**
‚Ä¢ Stateless services for easy horizontal scaling
‚Ä¢ Database sharding and replication
‚Ä¢ Caching strategies (Redis, Memcached)
‚Ä¢ Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
‚Ä¢ Message queues for async processing

**Load Balancing Strategies:**
‚Ä¢ Round Robin: Requests distributed equally
‚Ä¢ Least Connections: Route to server with fewest active connections
‚Ä¢ IP Hash: Route based on client IP
‚Ä¢ Geographic: Route based on client location`,

**Database Replication:**
‚Ä¢ Master-Slave: One write node, multiple read replicas
‚Ä¢ Master-Master: Multiple write nodes with conflict resolution
‚Ä¢ Use cases: Read-heavy applications, geographic distribution

**Database Sharding:**
‚Ä¢ Horizontal partitioning of data across multiple databases
‚Ä¢ Sharding strategies:
  - Range-based: Partition by data range (e.g., user ID 1-1000)
  - Hash-based: Use hash function to determine shard
  - Directory-based: Lookup service to find data location

**SQL vs NoSQL:**

**SQL Databases (RDBMS)**
‚Ä¢ ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
‚Ä¢ Complex queries with JOINs
‚Ä¢ Strong consistency
‚Ä¢ Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL
‚Ä¢ Use cases: Financial systems, traditional applications

**NoSQL Databases**
‚Ä¢ Eventual consistency
‚Ä¢ Horizontal scaling
‚Ä¢ Flexible schema
‚Ä¢ Types:
  - Document: MongoDB, CouchDB
  - Key-Value: Redis, DynamoDB
  - Column-family: Cassandra, HBase
  - Graph: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune

**CAP Theorem:**
You can only guarantee 2 out of 3:
‚Ä¢ Consistency: All nodes see the same data simultaneously
‚Ä¢ Availability: System remains operational
‚Ä¢ Partition tolerance: System continues despite network failures`,
